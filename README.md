# Optimizing demographic experience of the RCYC-members

**Authors:** Steven Yeretsian, Kiana Ravanasa, Aabid Anas, Elliot Min

**Language:** R

Using the R programming language, we use statistical analysis to provide the Royal Canadian Yacht Club insight on how to best manage their resources to maximize 
value. The data we are referencing includes 1000 people, represented twice in the year 2017 and 2020, so a sample of 2000 total. The data for this project can be found
in the STA130_project_data.csv file, and the slides for this project can be found in the Final.pdf file.
